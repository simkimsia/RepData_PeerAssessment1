# 2014 Reproducible Research repdata-002 Project 1

This is a submission by @simkimsia at GitHub for the Coursera course
Reproducible Research course code: repdata-002 Project 1 in May 2014.

Below are the instructions of the problem and copied directly from the coursera

This README is divided into 2 separate files:
 1. My own notes (here in READMEFIRST.md)
 2. Problem statement (read README.md)

# Assumptions

 1. Evaluator is using the activity dataset zip file and the csv file from the root folder of this project repo.
 2. Evaluator is using either Windows or Mac
 3. Evaluator has installed the packages `sqldf`, `ggplot2`
 
# How to begin

 1. Go <a href="http://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1"> Roger Peng's repo</a> and fork the project
 2. Read the README and unzip the activity zip file.
 3. Realize that:
   - the csv file is comma delimited
   - you are supposed to load the data from the text file unzipped from the zip file
 4. Get the dataset correctly and you should see 17568 obs. of 3 variables. This is largely taken care of by my `load_data.R` script
 5. Fill in the Rmarkdown file `PA1_template.Rmd` accordingly and answer the questions written inside. Feel free to write functions inside separate files and then source them inside the Rmd.
 6. Do run the plotting functions inside the Rmd file in order to display them inside the Rmd.
